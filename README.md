# Frameless

**The Real-Time Browser-Based Stealth Reflex Game**
*“Stay out of frame. Stay in the game.”*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

### The Story Behind Frameless (Spoiler: It Involves Me, A Video

So,I was scrolling endlessly through the internet rabbit hole, as one does (because who really studies 24/7?), and I stumble upon this hilarious video of someone awkwardly dodging a camera flash at a party — you know, the classic *“Don’t get caught in the photo!”* moment.

And then it hit me like a pixelated bolt of inspiration:

**“What if we turn this awkward dance into a real game? A game where you literally have to avoid being ‘caught’ in a camera frame... but on your computer? And what if it could detect your body in real-time and snap your photo when you fail?!”**

That’s how **Frameless** was born — fueled by caffeine, a bit of procrastination, and a pinch of “I can totally build this in JavaScript.”

---

### Vision

Frameless is more than a game — it’s a digital *hide-and-seek* where your body is the avatar, your living room is the arena, and your webcam is the judge, jury, and photographer. It’s a browser game that dares you to *not be seen* — or face the consequences of a photo snap that immortalizes your defeat (and probably your most unflattering pose).

---

### Mission

To make people move, laugh, compete, and share silly moments — all while pushing the limits of browser tech, real-time AI, and their own reflexes. No downloads, no installs, just pure *“don’t get caught!”* fun, anywhere, anytime.

---

## 🎯 Market & Industry Context

* The rise of browser-based games blending **real-time AI and webcam input** means low barrier-to-entry for viral, social gameplay.
* The TikTok generation loves quick, physical challenges with easy shareability.
* Unlike other reflex games, **Frameless** uses your actual body as the controller — no tapping required, just dodging (and sometimes flailing wildly).
* With in-browser pose detection, we tap into cutting-edge tech while keeping it accessible and free.

---

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Concept

* Player opens Frameless in their browser, grants webcam access.
* The screen displays **randomly positioned “danger zones” (frames/grids)**.
* Countdown begins — 5…4…3…
* Player must **avoid having any part of their body inside these frames** when the camera snaps a photo.
* If caught inside the frame, the player loses the round (and maybe their dignity).
* Score points by staying *frameless* and climbing levels as the grids become trickier.

## 🧩 Key Features & Modes

### MVP Features (v0.1)

* Webcam access with real-time video feed.
* Pose detection using TensorFlow\.js BlazePose or MediaPipe.
* Randomized frames overlaid on the camera feed.
* Collision detection between body keypoints and frames.
* Countdown timer triggering snapshot.
* Scoring and retry mechanism.
* Mobile & desktop friendly UI.

### Planned Game Modes

| Mode             | Description                                           |

## 🧠 Final Thoughts (From a Slightly Sleep-Deprived Founder)

I set out to make a simple, fun game inspired by a random viral video . What started as a goofy idea quickly grew into a compelling product vision — a unique blend of **technology, physicality, and humor** that anyone can play, laugh at, and share.

**Frameless** isn’t just about *dodging frames*; it’s about pushing the boundaries of what browser games can do, and reminding us all to maybe, just maybe, watch out for that camera flash next time.

# I am on this wild ride to build something fun, fresh, and (hopefully) totally *frameless.*
